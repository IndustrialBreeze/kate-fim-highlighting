Installation Instructions:


Copy fimpp.xml to ~/.kde4/share/apps/katepart/syntax/
(.kde4 is a hidden folder, either show hidden files/folders or type in the path
exactly for browsing or copying)

Create folders if they do not exist. This was written and tested on a 
KDE 4.9.x series system. Older versions may have different paths.

You can copy to the root folder structure so all users can use the highlighting
by placing it in /usr/share/apps/katepart/syntax/, but you will need root
permissions in doing so.
